This repo is archived.  Alternate processes for contributing ZFS changes
include following the [illumos procedures](https://illumos.org/docs/contributing/#code-review), or
opening a PR against [ZFSonLinux](https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs).

The reasoning behind this are outlined in an
[email](https://openzfs.topicbox.com/groups/developer/T1ea5f3fe16a66af6/openzfs-github-repo-eol)
to the developer@open-zfs.org mailing list, which is reproduced below:

> The OpenZFS code repository on github (http://github.com/openzfs/openzfs) is a clone of the illumos repo, with basically identical code.  The OpenZFS repo made it easier to contribute ZFS code to illumos, by leveraging the github pull request and code review processes, and by automatically building illumos and running the ZFS Test Suite.
>
> Unfortunately, the automated systems have atrophied and we lack the effort and interest to maintain it.  Meanwhile, the illumos code review and contribution process has been working well for a lot of ZFS changes (notably including ports from Linux).
>
>Since the utility of this repo has decreased, and the volunteer workforce isn't available to maintain it, we will be archiving http://github.com/openzfs/openzfs in the coming week.  Thank you to everyone who helped maintain this infrastructure, and to those who leveraged it to contribute over 500 commits to ZFS on illumos!  Alternate processes for contributing ZFS changes (including those in open PR's) include following the [illumos procedures](https://illumos.org/docs/contributing/#code-review), or opening a PR against [ZFSonLinux](https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs).
